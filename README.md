# Social Network API

## Description
Social Network API is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Data is the foundation of social network applications, so this one uses a NoSQL database, MongoDB, due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This application was built with the Mongoose ODM, Express.js for routing, and uses Moment.js for date formatting. 

When the server is started, the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database and users can test all API routes through Insomnia Core.
